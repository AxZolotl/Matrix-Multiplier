# Matrix Multiplier
A program that computes the matrix product from two given user input matrices

## I/O Format
- The first line of input asks user for M and N integers, which represents the numbers of rows and columns of the first matrix
- The next M number of lines will asks user for N numbers
- The same input format for the second matrix
- The program would then output the matrix product

## Brief Background
This program is an activity in Data Structures and Algorithm course that aims to apply the concept of the
data structure **Arrays**.
